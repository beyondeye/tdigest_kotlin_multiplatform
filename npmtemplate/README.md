# TDigest for kotlin multiplatform

This is a full port of the latest version(5/2019) of reference implementation of [TDigest algorithm](https://github.com/tdunning/t-digest) to kotlin multiplatform 
that outputs javascript code, with typescript type definitions
You can install this library  with
```commandline

TDigest binary compressed serialization is supported, with the same format used by the reference Java implementation
